# Tic-tac-Toe-using-Minimax-and-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
Alphaâ€“beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. This allows us to search much faster and even go into deeper levels in the game tree.

This code demonstrates the use of Alpha Beta Pruning for Game playing. 
Since, Tic Tac Toe has a depth of 9, a heuristic function i used that evaluates the Board State after searching through a depth of 3.
The heuristic function calculates the expected score of winning for the PC given the board state.
